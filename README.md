💪 AI-Powered Push-Up Tracker – Built with OpenCV & MediaPipe!

After a long time, I finally got back to building with OpenCV—and the result? A real-time fitness tracker that automatically counts push-ups using pose estimation. Yes, I ended up doing 300+ push-ups while testing it... and no, my arms haven’t recovered yet 😭

📸 The system uses OpenCV for live video capture and MediaPipe Pose to detect key body landmarks. By calculating the elbow angle, it determines whether a push-up is in the "up" or "down" stage, incrementing the counter in real-time.
